"""The parallel tower driver: execute EVERY tower verifier concurrently
(each in manifest chain mode, so no serial recursion), and pass iff all
pass. This is the full-re-execution battery for certification rounds --
wall time = the longest single verifier instead of the serial sum.
Manifest-vs-disk integrity is checked for all members up front.

RESUME CACHE (round 252, owner-commissioned; key hardened round 253
F253-1; EXECUTABLE-CONTENT keying round 254, owner: "no executable
code changes... this should not invalidate cache" -- the round-245
oneprime decision applied one layer up): each member's PASS is
recorded in checkpoints/tower_results.json under a key binding
  code_sha(member) + code_sha(every file in the member's COMPUTED
  transitive local import closure) + sha256(the paper),
where the closure is the member's full code REACH -- the
transitive import closure UNION every existing local .py named by
a string constant in any reach file's docstring-stripped AST (the
subprocess/chain reach the import walk cannot see; round-255
F255-1), iterated to a fixed point -- and code_sha is ckpt_key's
docstring-stripped-AST hash. Prose edits to members or their
substrates do NOT invalidate; any executable change anywhere in
the member's code reach does (the named-.py rule
over-approximates deliberately: over-invalidation, never a stale
PASS). The
PAPER stays byte-hashed deliberately: the needle gates match raw
substrings of the paper, so any paper byte can flip a gate outcome
-- a paper edit owes one live tower. The manifest sha is NOT in
the key (round 254): manifest-vs-disk consistency is re-verified
LIVE by this driver's integrity precheck on every invocation, so
binding it would only re-import byte sensitivity. NOT bound:
committed checkpoint DATA files -- their producing CODE is in the
reach (the instruments' own keying binds code, not state bytes,
and the zeros cache is anchor-validated, not content-addressed);
every gate re-runs live on every non-cached run; data-only
corruption of a cached pass's inputs is caught only at the next
key rotation or TOWER_FRESH -- the disclosed, accepted residual.
A member with a cached PASS at the current key is SKIPPED and reported
as "PASS (cached ...)"; the run's summary prints the live-vs-cached
census explicitly (no silent caps). This is the same
certify-against-committed-record philosophy as the manifest chain mode
(the cadence amendment): the cached PASS is the recorded observation of
an identical-input run, not a new execution. TOWER_FRESH=1 forces every
member to run live (reviewers may always force fresh). Run under
tools/research/run_with_checkpoints.sh so the cache is committed and
pushed every 10 minutes -- git is the only restore-proof storage.
Failures are never cached.
