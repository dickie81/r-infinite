# Infinite Nested Black-Hole Tower Cosmology

**∅ ≅ ℝ^∞**

### The Project
This repository contains the LaTeX source and forthcoming ancillary materials for the preprint  
**“Infinite Nested Black-Hole Tower Cosmology: 4D as the Stable Junction from Generalized Gregory–Laflamme Instability…”** (February 2026).  

The framework derives the entire observable 4D universe — its dimensionality, Standard Model gauge group and three generations with observed mass hierarchy, emergent time, gravity as long-wavelength interference, mild evolving dark energy consistent with DESI DR2, Bell violation, and global regularity — from zero free parameters, using solely the pre-geometric plenum defined by ∅ ≅ ℝ^∞ and its unique spectral regulator λ = ζ(−1) = −1/12.
